KJ Tip Calculator
=================

This is a simple iOS tip calculator app, thrown together in a few hours as an experiment in using Swift to develop an iOS app.

Also used as a playground for experiments with Xcode UI tests, [Calabash](http://calaba.sh), and UIAutomation-based testing.

Requires Xcode 10.1 and iOS 8 or newer.
